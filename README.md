# Reactified Octocats: A React.JS App
The Octodex is a fun way to celebrate a powerful tool we use for development. In that same spirit, recreate [this site](https://octodex.github.com/)

You'll identify the main `Component`s on the page and create React components for each, breaking down those `Component`s into smaller ones as needed.

## Objectives

- Learn to identify parts of a web site as `Component`s
- Use `app-app` (GAMMA stack) to build a React project
- Understand and use React components

## Stretch Objectives

- Understand and use "props" in React

## Requirements

- [ ] Create your React app using `app-app` `GAMMA`
- [ ] If you have done the non-React version of octodex, use your existing HTML as the `render()` method of your `App` component. Otherwise, figure out the main components of the page and implement the `render()` method of `App`
- [ ] Your CSS should be in `index.css` -- feel free to copy your previous project's css if you have done the non-React version of this assignment.
- [ ] You should have at _least_ two components... (Hint, perhaps Header, and an Octocat)
- [ ] Use props to try to reuse components (reuse the Octocat component)
